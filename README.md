# AutoEncoder_MNIST
I will use my deep learning knowledge to manipulate MNIST dataset by implementing autoencoder method.
I will do the AE in three ways: 
## *1.Build a simple autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset.
## *2.De-noise the image 
## *3.Build a convolutional autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset

## Notice
  This the notebook I unplod are my own solution to the Exercise on Udacity Computer Vision Program .If you need to get the original code please go to the Udacity official website.
